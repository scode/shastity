* Figure out a unit test strategy that neither involves copy pasta for each trait implementation,
  nor is opaque to an IDE nor requires external code-gen while still resulting in one test
  per feature/trait impl combo.
* Use non-exhaustive enums to describe general properties of errors.
* Provide a stream/batch/txn based API for mutations to allow performance optimization when bulk
  writing.
* Final decision on whether to use newtypes for stuff like Oid, Content.
