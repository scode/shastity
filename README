shastity - hash-based deduplicating secure remote backups

== Status ==

This is in-development software (not even alpha level). Do not
use. Yet.

== Running the unit tests ==

Ensure the 'src' directory is in your python path, such as by:

  export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src

Run all unit tests by:

  python test/test.py

If you want the unit tests to include tests that depend on the S3
backend, set the environment variable:

  SHASTITY_UNITTEST_S3_BUCKET

To the name of the bucket to use for testing.
